# Leon Bridges

Leon's voice and the chorus woman voice are incredible and delightful to hear.

# Arctic Monkeys

These guys are just the best. All of their albums are incredible and full of great music. Every album has a different energy and theme and it makes them incredible. I think I've been listening to them for over a decade now.

# Stereophonics

Incredible band. All of their songs are full of emotions and/or energy. What I like most of this band is how they can transmit all of those emotions in the lyrics and rythm. They sing to love, friends, life, and death.
